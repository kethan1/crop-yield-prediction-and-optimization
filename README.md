In developing countries, agriculture continues to be the main source of employment, livelihood, and income for between 50% - 90% of the population. Climate change, however, is the leading cause of decreased crop yields and increased crop diseases. This, in turn, has greatly impacted the financial state of a significant part of the population. To help farmers mitigate the consequences of climate change and decrease third world poverty founded on poor harvests, I developed a machine learning model that helps farmers predict and optimize crop yield. 

## Downloading the models
Go to https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aln5W1s_yb8FvsdACvqZEUUUQxK2Dg?e=CQ6YZ7 to download the models. Put them in the repo's folder.

## Deploying to Heroku
I will not be deplying this app to Heroku because of the difficulty of uploading the large models (nearly 5 GB combined) to the dyno.

## Running locally
Once you have the models downloaded, you can run the app locally with the command: `python app.py`.
